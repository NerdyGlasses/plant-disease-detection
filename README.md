Plant Disease Detection and Growth Monitoring Using IoT and ML :
- It detects the rice plant disease detection by using CNN model. 
- It also monitors the growth of the plant based on the information send by the sensors and so proper growth for the plant will be estimated. 
- The sensors used are DHT11 for temperature and humidity, LDR for light intensity and soil moisture for measururing the water content in the soil. 
- The sensor information is stored on cloud. The cloud used is Thingspeak. 
- CNN Model includes webcam for getting the input images and later on CNN classifier will be used for actual disease detection and classification. 
- A website is created using Streamlit, where prediction model and Thingspeak graphs and data are displayed. 
- It also gives solutions and symptoms of the disease.
